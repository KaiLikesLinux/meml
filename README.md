# Minimal Efficient Markup Language
Extension: `.meml`

## What is MEML?
After a long day with HTML, I noticed that HTML is a pain. Writing 30 lines of code to get a decent setup was something I did not want to deal with. Instead, I designed a language that attepted to solve the issue. With many inspirations from LISP, SASS, and HTML itself, MEML was born. With the sole purpose to minimize how much I need to write to build a decent website, something I need to do a lot.

MEML is built using SASS for styling, (precompiled in the application), and otherwise uses JavaScript to build the HTML file (as it was decided I wanted to test Deno, and since it makes sense for the situation of web stuff).
